1. install mksquashfs-tools
on ubuntu you do this via
sudo apt-get install squashfs-tools

2. Obtain an wikipedia html dump from static.wikipedia.org
be careful! the august 2007 version of the english wikipdia is 120GB extracted!!

3. extract it to the folder where your scripts are located
7zr x wikipedia-de-html.7z

your directory structure for eg. german wikipedia dump (26GB extracted) should look like this:

de/ <= all your extracted files
README <= this file
remove_files.sh <= bash script for removing unnecesarry files like talk pages
create_linkindex.pl <= perl script for creating a links.list in eayh directory
remove_everything.pl <= clean up all remainig junk in the dump files
rename.pl <= rename everything

4. edit all scripts for your language!

heavy editing is to be done on remove_files.sh
in the perl scripts you have to change this line according to your language folder:
find(\&filehandler, "de");

5. delete unnecessary files and dirs in your dump
	rm -r de/COPYING.html de/index.html de/skins/ de/raw/ de/images/ de/upload/
6. run remove_files.sh
7. run create_linkindex.pl
8. now delete all links with
	find de/ -size -2k -type f -name '*.html' -delete
9. run remove_everything.pl
10. run rename.pl
11. create the image file with
	mksquashfs /de your_image_name
12. test it and drop me a line if sth. went wrong!
